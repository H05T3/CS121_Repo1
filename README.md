# ABOUT ME


## Hi my name is Humberto.

I am hoping to learn some new languages in this class and hope to learn some new techniques which I may apply to my own code which I plan to write. 

Something that I believe is interesting about myself is that I am a **huge plane nerd**. I hope to in the future to use my skills in comp
sci to help further the advancements in the aviation community.
* *If comp sci doesn't work out then I am definitely switching to engineering.* *

### Here is a list cuz I need to know hwo to do that.

* This is a list

* This is another list object

* Object three of course

* Object four, wow...

### This is a code block that called helloWorld but says "This is a code block" instead...
```
def helloWorld():
	print("This is a code block")
helloWorld()
```
